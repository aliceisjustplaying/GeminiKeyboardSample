# Gemini Voice Keyboard for iOS

An end-to-end iOS sample for Gemini 3.5 Live transcription and spoken translation from a custom keyboard. Tap **Dictate** or **Translate**, speak, tap again, and the result is inserted into the active text field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a personal developer sample, not a production SDK or an App Store-ready app. Its Debug-only cold handoff uses private iOS behavior for a smoother personal-device demo. Release compiles that behavior out.

## What it demonstrates

- `gemini-3.5-transcribe-live` streaming microphone audio and returning live text.
- `gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview` translating speech while it is spoken.
- A custom keyboard controlling microphone capture in its containing app through an App Group. Keyboard extensions cannot access the microphone themselves.
- Safe Finish, Cancel, fallback, recovery, and insertion into the original text field.
- A project-local typing surface adapted from KeyboardKit, with no runtime library dependency.

## Custom vocabulary (this fork)

Open **Custom vocabulary** in the Gemini Voice app. Add one word or phrase per line, then tap **Save**. Edit or remove lines to change the list; save an empty list to clear it. **Cancel** discards edits.

Your list stays saved on this phone. The app sends it to Google to help recognize your words when you dictate. Changes apply to the next recording. If the app automatically retries a failed dictation, it keeps the list that recording started with. Retrying from Saved recordings uses your latest saved list. The live Translate feature does not use these hints. Hints guide recognition; they do not force exact replacements.

Blank lines and exact duplicates are ignored. The editor supports up to 1,000 unique terms and blocks saving above that limit. Google recommends a focused list of up to 100 terms for best results. See Google's [Live vocabulary documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/live-transcribe#custom-vocabulary-biasing) and [batch vocabulary documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/transcribe#custom-vocabulary).

## Model routing

The keyboard voice buttons always start a Gemini Live session. There is no batch-mode toggle.

| Action | Primary model | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dictate** | `gemini-3.5-transcribe-live` | `gemini-3.5-transcribe` after a Live failure |
| **Translate** | `gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview` | `gemini-3.5-transcribe` + `gemini-3.5-flash` after a Live failure |
| **Camera OCR** | `gemini-3.8-flash` | None |

The Flash models are never used for a normal keyboard voice request. They are limited to OCR and the emergency text-only translation step after Live has failed.

Model IDs and preview APIs change. Verify them against Google's [Live transcription](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/live-transcribe), [Live translation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/live-translate), and [Gemini 3.8 Flash](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-3.8-flash) documentation before adopting the sample.

## How it works

```text
Custom keyboard
  │  start / finish / cancel + request ID
  ▼
Locked App Group store
  │
  ▼
Containing app microphone relay
  ├─ PCM stream → Gemini Live
  └─ protected WAV → fallback/retry only
  │
  ▼
Matching App Group result
  │
  ▼
UITextDocumentProxy.insertText
```

The important code is intentionally easy to find:

| Area | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Live model setup, streaming, events, and finalization | [`App/Gemini/Live`](App/Gemini/Live) |
| Batch fallback and OCR requests | [`App/Gemini/Batch`](App/Gemini/Batch) |
| Microphone capture and PCM conversion | [`App/Audio`](App/Audio) |
| App-side keyboard relay | [`App/Relay`](App/Relay) |
| Keyboard controller and UI | [`KeyboardExtension`](KeyboardExtension) |
| Cross-process request/result protocol | [`Shared/Relay`](Shared/Relay) |

## Requirements

- Xcode 26.6 or later
- iOS 26 or later
- A physical iPhone
- An Apple Developer team with three bundle identifiers and one shared App Group
- A Gemini API key for personal development
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)

## Run the sample

1. Create the local configuration:

   ```sh
   cp Config/Secrets.xcconfig.example Config/Secrets.xcconfig
   ```

2. Add your Apple team, unique bundle identifiers, App Group, and Gemini API key to `Config/Secrets.xcconfig`.

3. Register the same identifiers and App Group in your Apple Developer account, then generate the project:

   ```sh
   xcodegen generate
   ```

4. Run the simulator test suite:

   ```sh
   ./Scripts/test.sh
   ```

5. Deploy to a paired iPhone:

   ```sh
   xcrun devicectl list devices
   ./Scripts/deploy-device.sh <device-identifier>
   ```

6. On the iPhone, add **Gemini Voice** under **Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards**, enable **Allow Full Access**, open the containing app once, and grant microphone access.

7. In any normal text field, select the keyboard and try **Dictate** or **Translate**. Tap the active button again to Finish; use **X** to discard.

## Behavior worth knowing

- **Warm relay is the intended path.** The containing app keeps its microphone session armed briefly in the background, so the keyboard can start immediately without leaving the text field.
- **Cold relay needs a handoff.** Release asks the user to return manually. The personal Debug build contains an unsupported automatic-return experiment.
- **Finish is not Cancel.** Finish drains accepted audio and waits for the authoritative final result. Cancel remains available while recording or processing; it stops the work, deletes the temporary recording, and inserts nothing.
- **Long recordings auto-finish at five minutes.** This bounds background and fallback resource use without interrupting normal dictation-length speech.
- **Fallback is explicit.** A complete local WAV is used only when Live fails after Finish. Failed recordings remain available for a user-initiated retry.
- **Insertion is guarded.** A result is inserted automatically only when its request and document anchor still match; otherwise the keyboard offers **Insert latest**.

## Security boundary

`Config/Secrets.xcconfig` is ignored by Git, but a Debug key compiled into an app is still extractable. Use a restricted development key with billing limits.

Production software should keep long-lived keys on a backend, proxy batch requests, and issue constrained [ephemeral tokens](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/ephemeral-tokens) for direct Live connections. Review the included privacy manifests and make your own privacy disclosures.
